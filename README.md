# Project Overview </br>

The goal of this project is to build a Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into the performance and operations of National Rail. The dashboard should be interactive and allow the management team to explore various metrics and trends.

# Objectives
The dashboard should help the management team: </br>

### Identify the Most Popular Routes:</br>

Visualize the top routes based on passenger numbers.</br>
Highlight the routes with the highest revenue.</br>
### Determine Peak Travel Times:</br>

Analyze passenger traffic by time of day, day of the week, and season.</br>
Identify patterns and trends in travel times.</br>
### Analyze Revenue from Different Ticket Types & Classes:</br>

Break down revenue by ticket type (e.g., advance, off-peak, anytime).</br>
Compare revenue generated from different ticket classes (e.g., standard, first class).</br>
### Diagnose On-Time Performance and Contributing Factors:</br>

Evaluate the punctuality of trains.</br>
Investigate the reasons for delays and their frequency.</br>

# Data Sources</br>
